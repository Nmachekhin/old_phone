Device User Manual

1) Construction
The top of the phone houses the handset, which presses the "hang up" button when placed down. The front panel features a rotary dial for entering numbers. It also includes a battery charge indicator with three sections:

Red: Overvoltage.
Black: Full charge.
Green: Normal battery range.

On the back of the phone, there is a power button and a USB Type-C port for charging. Below the handset cradle on the back is a window that allows the user to see the internal electronics in operation.




2) Powering On/Off and Charging
To turn the device on or off, press the button located on the back panel. Check the charge indicator to verify operation; it should move away from the far-left position. Alternatively, look through the rear window for illuminated red indicators inside.
If the needle does not move or moves only slightly when powered on, and the internal indicators are off, the battery is likely discharged, requiring a recharge.
Charge the device via USB Type-C using a PowerDelivery protocol at 9V and up to 2.5A. When charger is connected, a blue indicator near the port will light up, signaling successful connection. A fully charged battery is indicated when the charge meter enters the red zone. After disconnecting the charger, the indicator should remain in the green zone.
The device is equipped with overcharge protection, so remaining in the red zone while connected to a charger is not dangerous.

3) Receiving/Ending a Call
To keep the device ready for incoming calls, place the handset in its cradle on the body. When the phone rings, pick up the handset to accept the call. The connection will be established almost immediately.
To end a call, either return the handset to its cradle or manually press the "hang up" button. If the call ends without placing the handset down, a series of short beeps will sound in the receiver.

4) Ending a Call Manually
If manually pressing the "hang up" button, wait for a sound signal (a short beep). If physically placing the handset back, allow at least one second for the system to process.

5) Making a Call
To make an outgoing call:

1.Pick up the handset and wait for a long beep, indicating the device is ready.
2.Begin entering the number; the beep will stop as you start dialing.
3.Insert your finger into the hole corresponding to the desired digit and rotate the dial clockwise until your finger reaches the metal stop. Release the dial and allow it to return to its starting position before dialing the next digit.
4.Do not begin entering the next digit until the dial stops moving and the clicking sound ceases.

After completing the number, wait approximately 4 seconds for a short beep in the receiver, which signals the start of the outgoing call.
In case of an incorrect entry, hang up and start dialing the number again.

6) Unforeseen Situations
If the device malfunctions or experiences a software issue, hang up the handset. If the issue persists, turn the device off and on again.
If smoke, sparks, or damage to the device are observed, immediately turn it off, implement fire safety measures if necessary, and promptly contact the manufacturer.
